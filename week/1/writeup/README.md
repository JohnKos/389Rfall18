### Part 2 (75 pts)

You should tell your boss first of all. If the boss fails to respond after several notices you could let him know that your next step is to let a consumer watch dog know. If he fails to follow through then you should go to the consumer watch dog. Going to the public may be dangerous because that opens up people to knowing about the exploit and taking advantage of it. If the company is unwilling to postpone release, alert what ever entity is possible to stop them. If you do nothing you are partly responsible for any harm.

People often shirk off the possibility that apathy is enabling harm. If you have the ability to help people or do good in the smallest way then you should strive too. Obviously this has many shades of gray and the affect the action may have on you as well as the amount of seperation between your actions and the harm make it so the answer is not always cut and dry. In this example however, I think it is. I would never consider my job more important than other peoples lives, and failing to stop the bugs or exploits from become public news just passively making that descision. I believe this so firmly that if someone was in a similar situation and failed to report the bugs, they should be convicted of manslaughter. This would be dangerous negligence, and easily falls under manslaughters definition on top of being morally reprehensible.
