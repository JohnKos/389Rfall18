### Part 2 (55 pts)

trying to log into the IP using ssh. could not get in with IP on admin page but got in using root on website name. got new IP 142.93.118.186. Decided to nmap scan the Ip's I found on the website. Rockyou.txt crashes everytime I open it, going to open it in my main OS to see if I can find any pokemon passwords. Noticed a couple pikachu names, going to try to unzip rockyou file again. Ran online Nmap confirms that admin page is open for http and normal website is open for ssh and http. tried looking for a way to get a professional username could access the normal domain name with root but still need a password. maybe more info in there. Ran Normal nmap because I could not get find info to get into regular site. Nmapped the admin page, and found more open ports 1337, 2222, 10010. guessing at username while having brute force program running. got in after asking for help with username. went to flight log in the instagram post flag is CMSC389R-{c0rn3rstone-air-27670}
